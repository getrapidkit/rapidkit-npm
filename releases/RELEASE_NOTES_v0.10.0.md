# Release Notes - v0.10.0

**Release Date:** November 8, 2025

## 🎉 Major Changes

### Bundle Optimization
We've completely optimized the build process with **tsup**, resulting in dramatic improvements:

- **80% smaller bundle size** (208KB → 40KB)
- **Faster installation** - Single minified bundle
- **Faster startup** - Optimized for Node.js 18+
- **Production-ready** - Minified and tree-shaked
- **No source maps** in production builds

### New Versioning Strategy
We've switched from `beta` versioning to `0.x.x` to better reflect the development phase:

- `0.x.x` indicates pre-stable development
- API may change between minor versions
- Will release `1.0.0` when RapidKit Python is published on PyPI
- More transparent about development status

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Bundle Size | 208KB | 40KB | **80% reduction** |
| Files | 30+ files | 1 file | **Simplified** |
| Startup Time | ~150ms | ~80ms | **47% faster** |
